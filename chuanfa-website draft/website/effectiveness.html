					<h3>System Effectiveness</h3>
					<div>
						<p>
							<strong>General</strong> <br>
							The <strong>Mobileye™ Collision prevention Assistance System (CPAS)</strong> 
							is a driver assistance 
							system for collision prevention and mitigation.
							CPAS is based on a camera located on the vehicle’s front windshield that watches
							the road ahead. The CPAS utilizes advanced vision technologies for:
							<ul>
							<li><strong>Lane detection and road curvature calculation</strong>
							– the CPAS detects and measures lane position relative to the vehicle and provides distance to lane marks, 
							detection of lane crossing including lane crossing prediction 
							(by calculating Time to Lane Crossing - TLC) for earlier warnings than received from actual rumble-strips.
							</li>
							<li><strong>Vehicle detection </strong>
							the CPAS detects vehicles ahead, and measures their distance, azimuth, relative speed 
							and Time to Contact (TTC). The CPAS uses these calculations for providing continuous headway 
							and potential collision related information. The road curvature calculation provided by the lane 
							detection capability enables to identify which of the vehicles ahead is in the same lane as the “host vehicle”.
							</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
						Its detection of vehicles and lane markings provides
						the driver with the following saftey alert types:<br>
						
						<ul>
						<li><strong>Forward Collision Warning (FCW)</strong> – alerting the driver of an 
						impending collision with the vehicle ahead (up to 2.7 seconds before collision occurs)</li>
						<li><strong>Lane Departure Warning (LDW)</strong> – acting as “audible rumble strips”,
						LDW produces an alert sound up to 0.5 seconds before unintentionally
						departing from the lane or the road altogether</li>
						<li><strong>Headway Monitoring and Warning (HMW)</strong> – enables continuous monitoring 
						of the driving distance (headway) kept from the vehicle ahead, 
						and warns the driver when headway decreases to a dangerous level</li>
						</ul>
						</p>
						<br>
						
						These 3 features correspond with 3 of the leading causes of road collisions:<br>
						<ul>
						<li>Rear-end collisions caused by driver inattention</li>
						<li>Lane departure, and Run Off Road (ROR) collisions</li>
						<li>Rear-end collisions caused by insufficient distance keeping</li>	
						</ul>
						
						<hr>
						<strong>Statistics on Accidents Worldwide</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>There are 1.2 million fatalities yearly worldwide due to road accidents - 3242 people a day!</li>
							<li>According to the World Health Organization, road accident fatalities worldwide are expected to rise by 67% by the year 2020.</li>
							<li>Over 20 million people are injured each year in road accidents</li>
							<li>Financial damages of road accidents are ~2% of world GDP.</li>
							<li>In the US, in 2003 there were 6 million accidents, costing $230 million; averaging $38,000 per accident – these statistics have been steady in recent years.</li>
						</ul>
						<br>
						Studies and Statistics on Causes of Accidents and Accident Prevention:<br>
						<ul>
							<li>93% of all accidents are due to human factor (Driver inattention cited as the primary cause for accidents).</li>
							<li>Nearly 80% of all crashes involve driver inattention within three 
							seconds before the event. Examples of types of inattention that increase crash risk:</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Talking on a cell phone (increases risk by 30%)</li>
								<li>Dialing a cell phone (increases risk by 300%)</li>
								<li>Drowsiness (increases risk by 400% and responsible for ~23% of all crashes and near-crashes)</li>
								<li>Reaching for moving objects, like a falling cup (increases risk by 900%)</li>
							</ul>
							<li>“One in every five vehicle accidents in Germany is caused by drowsiness at the wheel… momentary drowsiness or 
							inattentiveness is responsible for one in every four accidents on German motorways… 
							In the United States, as many as 40 percent of highway accidents are due to drowsiness at the wheel…
							The economic loss that such vehicle accidents cause each year is estimated at 
							5 billion euros ($6.4 billion) in Germany alone. ”</li>
							<li>Run Off Road accidents account for nearly 20% of road accidents 
							and are responsible for 60% of all road accident fatalities.</li>
							<li>“In a study done at Volkswagen, an analysis of the pre-crash braking behavior 
							shows that in severe accidents about 85% of drivers either did not brake at all or not to
							the full possible deceleration.”</li>
							<li>Rear-end collision accidents account for about 28% of road accidents.</li>
						</ul>
						<br>
						<strong>Forward Collision Warning (FCW) Systems:</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>A study by Daimler Benz shows that an extra 0.5 second early warning can prevent 60% 
							of rear-end collisions, and 1.5 seconds will prevent 90% of them.</li>
							<li>A University of Adelaide study showed that in 29% of cases the driver did not attempt to brake at all 
							before the collision [7] either because they were not aware of the danger at all, 
							or had insufficient time to react.</li>
							<li>CPAS provides a Forward Collision Warning to the driver 2.7 seconds on average before
							colliding with the vehicle ahead. The average driver takes 0.66 seconds to press the brakes [8]. 
							Thus, on average, the CPAS enables the driver a critical 2 seconds of actual braking!</li>												
						</ul>
						<strong>Empiric Evidence of Effective Accident Reduction<br>Strips:</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>“A New York study showed…on the New York State Thruway, ROR crashes were reduced 88 percent, 
							from a high of 588 crashes in 1993 to 74 in 1997. Total injuries were reduced 87 percent, 
							from a 1992 high of 
							407 to 54 in 1997. Fatalities were reduced 95 percent, from 17 in 1991 and 1992 to 1 fatality 
							in 1997.”</li>
							<li>“After Delaware DOT installed centerline rumble strips on U.S. Route 301--a two-lane, 
							undivided rural highway with 
							a high fatality rate--the head-on collision rate decreased 90 percent, and fatalities 
							decreased to zero. These dramatic safety improvements were achieved despite a 30 percent 
							increase in traffic.” [9].</li>
						</ul>
						<strong>Headway warning</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>“…drivers tend to overestimate their headway and consequently drive with short and 
							potentially dangerous headways…” [10]</li>
							<li>“…IVCAWS (in-vehicle collision avoidance warning systems) are a useful tool for educating 
							drivers to estimate headway more accurately… after a relatively short exposure to the system, 
							drivers were able to maintain longer and safer headways for at least six months…” [8]</li>
							<li>“…In the U.S., rear-end collisions represent approximately 30% of all car crashes on public 
							roads [NHTSA, 1999]. One of the major causes of such accidents is the failure of the following 
							car to maintain the proper distance from the lead car. In most cases, failure to 
							maintain safe headway can be attributed to driver inattention and/or misjudgment of 
							distance [Knipling et al.,1993]… ” [11]</li>

						<strong>Mobileye CPAS Abilities and Behavior</strong><br>
						Mobileye is the winner of the 2006 Entrepreneurial Company of the Year Award in the Automotive 
						Industry by Frost & Sullivan, who have stated:<br>
						“The passenger cars in Europe are likely to be factory installed with the vision-based LDW starting 
						from 2007 and <strong>at least five car platforms are expected to be installed with this system supplied 
						by Mobileye in 2007.</strong> By 2010, all major vehicle manufacturers are expected to introduce the 
						vision-based safety systems in the market. <strong>Mobileye has got a head start over its competitors,
						since its system is capable of performing 	
						functions such as forward collision warning, headway warning and LDW in addition to the 
						video-collision recording option.”</strong><br><br>
						
						“Market participants have advocated the cost and life saving potential of the LDW system and fleet 
						owners are beginning to realize the value in utilizing the LDW system. <strong>Currently, the aftermarket
						system supplied by other market participants offer only the LDW function. However, by providing
						more functions over and above the LDW function, for the same price as the companies’ competitors,
						Frost & Sullivan expects Mobileye to capture a large chunk of the truck aftermarket.”</strong><br><br>
						Driver response time is crucial when attempting to avoid a road accident. Mobileye CPAS provides a 
						distracted driver with early warnings 
						that give them more time to react and regain control of the situation which otherwise would 
						end in a certain collision. <br><br>
						It has been demonstrated already that LDW systems can dramatically reduce the amount of accidents in commercial fleets.<br><br>
						Surmounting the abilities of its competitors’, Mobileye CPAS supplies not one, but three types of warnings in road scenarios that are responsible <strong>for more than 65% of all road accident fatalities.</strong><br><br>
