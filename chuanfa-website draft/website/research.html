								<p>The Dutch Ministry of Transport has recently released the
									TNO Final Report, which contains the findings of&Acirc;&nbsp; a
									large-scale field operational test of active driver assistance
									systems, so called accident prevention systems (APS), for
									lorries.</p>

								<p>This large-scale study involved more than 2,400 lorries
									supplied by 123 companies and lasted 8 months. During this time
									a total of around 77 million kilometers of driving behavior
									were measured during normal daily driving on Dutch motorways.</p>

									<p>&quot;A forward collision warning system will have a
										high potential in preventing rear end accidents.&quot;</p>

									<p>&quot;Most often the cause of such accidents is

										<p>&quot;Most drivers are positive or neutral about making
											AWS obligatory.&quot; (pp. 26, Sec. 6.3.1)</p>

										<div></div>

										<p>&quot;In the second measurement, more drivers indicate
											that AWS simplifies the task of driving in comparison with
											the first measurement. In that measurement, they also
											recommend the system more empathically within their own
											environment.&quot; (pp. 26, Sec. 6.3.1)</p>

										<p>&quot;In the second measurement, drivers indicate that
											they maintain a greater following distance when using
											HMW&quot; (pp. 27)</p>

										<p>&quot;Most of them always have AWS switched on,
											irrespective of the type of road or prevailing weather
											conditions.&quot; (pp. 27)</p>

										<p>&quot;In general, we can state that users do not enjoy
											being corrected, but do view the system as an asset.&quot;
											(pp. 27, Sec. 6.3.2)</p>

										<p>
											&quot;LDW and HMW in their own car?<br /> The majority of
											participants in the pilot would &acirc;&euro;&ldquo;
											depending on the price &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; like to have LDW
											and HMW installed in their own cars. They refer to an average
											price of &acirc;&sbquo;&not;500 (with exceptions ranging from
											&acirc;&sbquo;&not;250 until &acirc;&sbquo;&not;5,000).&quot;
											(pp. 28)
										</p>

										<p>&quot;The majority of participants in the pilot are
											satisfied with AWS. They find the system easy to use and
											believe that driving with both LDW and HMW is conducive to
											road safety. This is due to the fact that
											drivers&acirc;&euro;&trade; adapt their driving behavior (in
											a positive sense) in order to minimise the number of
											warnings. Participants also maintain their distance better,
											use their indicators more often and maintain their direction
											on the road more effectively. Furthermore, they also find the
											task of driving to be less demanding overall. Bear in mind
											though that this is their opinion. &quot; (pp. 28)</p>

										<p>
											<strong>Objective studies:</strong>
										</p>

										<p>&quot;The LDW system issues a warning every time the
											vehicle crosses a line (desired or undesired) that does not
											go hand in hand with the use of direction indicators. LDW
											therefore encourages the use of indicators. 10. Direction
											indicators are used more often and more effectively.&quot;
											(pp. 46)</p>

										<p>&quot;In addition to more effective use of direction
											indicators, it is likely that drivers will maintain a greater
											distance from line markings due to the LDW system. This is
											reflected in both SDLP and the average position of the
											vehicle in relation to the middle of the lane. &quot; (pp.
											46)</p>

										<p>&quot;Table 8.7 displays the result of this analysis.
											We can conclude from the table, for example, that ACC can
											prevent a maximum of 48.8% of accidents on through-roads (on
											road sections). For LDW, this is 4.6%. Together, ACC and LDW
											reduce the number of accidents on through- roads by a maximum
											of 53.4%. This is 6.7% of the total number of accidents on
											road sections and 3.4% of the total number of accidents (road
											sections and intersections combined). &quot; (pp. 51)</p>

										<p>&quot;On the basis of changes in the use of direction
											indicators (increase of roughly 20%, depending on the road
											type) and the number of unintentional line crossings (also
											20% approximately), we discover an effectiveness of 20% for
											LDW. &quot; (pp. 95)</p>
